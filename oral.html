        <h4><b>1. Introduction</b></h4>
        <p>Cinema has always had a special connection to society. It’s not just about entertainment; it has reflected our dreams, struggles, and values. Today, I’ll show you how cinema has evolved across generations, from giving people hope and education in the past to focusing on entertainment today.</p>
        
        <h4><b>2. Silent/Greatest Generation (1920s–1940s)</b></h4>
        <p>Let’s start with the 1920s to 1940s. This was a time of great challenges, with World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II. People used cinema as a way to escape and find hope.
        For example, in the 1920s, Flappers symbolized freedom and rebellion. They challenged old traditions and celebrated individuality. This spirit was reflected in movies of the time.
        Later, during the 1940s, films like Disney’s Dumbo helped people forget their struggles. With its bright colors and magical story, it offered a brief escape from harsh realities.</p>
        
        <h4><b>3. Gen Z (2000s–Present)</b></h4>
        <p>Fast forward, let’s look at today’s generation. Cinema has shifted from escapism to focusing on entertainment and reflecting modern issues.
        For instance, the movie Civil War explores divisions in America, showing how filmmakers use cinema to highlight real-world problems.
        On the other hand, movies like Star Wars use dark themes, battles, and apocalyptic visuals. People today seem to enjoy watching conflict and drama rather than escaping from it.</p>
        
        <h4><b>4. Key Comparison</b></h4>
        <p>In the past, cinema gave people hope, taught lessons, and helped them escape. Today, it entertains by reflecting modern issues and conflicts. While the role of cinema has changed, its connection to society remains strong.</p>
        
        <h4><b>5. Conclusion</b></h4>
        <p>If you want to sum up, cinema has always influenced society. It evolved from being a source of hope and education to focusing on entertainment and reflection of today’s world. This shift shows how cinema mirrors the changes in our lives.</p>
