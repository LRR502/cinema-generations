Civil War

This document is an extract from a youtube Channel : Luc Forsyth.

The author talks about the film Civil War and its purpose which is a criticism of Texas and California’s relationship, among others.

In the 1940's, politicians used to fight each others and populations were against it contrary to the 2020's. Nowadays, Americans like to watch violence in cinema. Civil War was criticized a lot by the audience because they couldn’t recognize themselves and their political opinions, which reinforced what the film highlights.


Dumbo

In the 1940's, Americans were trying to escape from war, depression, and from the real world. Cinema and animated films were a way to. Walt Disney released Dumbo in 1941, during the great depression. The extraordinary story of a flying elephant amazed the world and for an hour, they were not focused on atrocities anymore, they were free.

This film was made with childish colors and a graphic style that took the public back to their childhood and created a feeling of nostalgia.


Star Wars

Walt Disney pictures released Star Wars: The force wakens in 2017. Contrary to the 1940's, today’s people watch and entertain from war and politics. Star Wars context is not meant to make people escape from reality.

Disney uses fights and atrocities to create a feeling of joy and consideration about the real world.
Star Wars poster is made of dark colors and weapons, it’s an apocalyptic fiction.


The Great Dictator

Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator criticized A.Hitler and fascism, leading to its ban in Nazi-controlled areas. Despite fears in Britain and the U.S. due to appeasement and neutrality, Chaplin used cinema to challenge tyranny. The film showed how art could confront oppression and inspire reflection even in tense times.

Look, the idea of freedom and escapism is obserbable everywhere in the greatest/silent generation set: on the Dumbo’s poster with childish colors and absurd concepts, in the Chaplin’s film because of the funny caricature made of A.Hitler and through the Flappers as the symbol of freedom that these “new women” wanted to put across.

This is contrary to the Gen Z set where is explained the fact that people now entertain on apocalyptic fictions as war, that is what is seen on the Star Wars poster through Sci-Fi weapons, dark colors and fights.
Is shown in the Luc Forsyth video the way filmmakers fantasize about creating dystopic films like Civil War that talks about the division in America through the war multiple states face (fictionnaly).
The Multilingual's article shows that cinema is now more used as an amusement only, thanks to streaming plateforms that allow to watch almost everything from home. Cinema has lost its educational role for entertainment.
